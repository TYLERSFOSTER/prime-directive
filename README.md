# The Prime Directive
**Operational Protocol for Human ↔ LLM Engineering Collaboration**

This repository contains the **Prime Directive** — a document in *vibe engineering* defining relational control and reasoning discipline for stable, high-bandwidth collaboration between a **Project Owner (Human)** and an **Embedded Engineering Consultant (LLM)**.

The directive establishes:
- Clear hierarchy of control (*Human → Directive → Model*)
- Dynamic reasoning rules for synchronization with reality
- Behavioral constraints for consultant-mode operation
