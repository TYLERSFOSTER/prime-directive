# The Prime Directive
**Operational Protocol for Human ↔ LLM Engineering Collaboration**

This repository contains the **Prime Directive** — a document in *vibe engineering* defining relational control and reasoning discipline for stable, high-bandwidth collaboration between a **Project Owner (Human)** and an **Embedded Engineering Consultant (LLM)**.

The directive establishes:
- Clear hierarchy of control (*Human → Directive → Model*)
- Dynamic reasoning rules for synchronization with reality
- Behavioral constraints for consultant-mode operation

## Experimental Status

This project is an **open experiment** in LLM behavioral design and collaborative control theory.  
It explores whether explicit conversational protocols can improve stability, coherence, and epistemic discipline in human–model engineering work.

No claims are made about its completeness, reliability, or general applicability.  
Feedback, field reports, and alternative formulations are welcome — this is a *living experiment* in how shared reasoning protocols might evolve.
